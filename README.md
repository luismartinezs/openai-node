# Playground for OpenAI

NodeJS scripts to interact with openai in different ways, mainly created as a way to challenge myself

## Scripts

- [x] Create a script that sends an input and returns response
- [ ] It prepends the history (up to a prompt + character limit) to the input and sends it
- [ ] It keeps a summary of the history (up to a limit) and prepends it to input
